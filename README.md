# 🚦 YOLO Real-Time Object Detection Comparison

## 📌 Project Overview
This project compares different YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for **real-time object detection** based on performance metrics such as **FPS, inference time, and detection accuracy**.

The goal is to identify the most efficient YOLO model suitable for real-time applications.
